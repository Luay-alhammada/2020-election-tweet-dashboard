 Project Overview
 The objective of this project is to analyze Twitter data related to the 2020 U.S. election using
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) and time series analysis to uncover patterns in public
 sentiment, trending topics, and engagement over time and across regions. The project will
 involve sentiment analysis, trend detection, and predictive modeling to understand how
 discussions evolved during the election period. The final deliverable will be an interactive
 dashboard that visualizes these insights, allowing users to explore the data and gain actionable
 information about public opinion and the impact of key events.
 Tasks
 1. Time Series Analysis
 Level 1:
 a. Geospatial Time Series Analysis
 i.
 Objective: Analyze the time series data to identify trends in tweet
 activity, sentiment, and engagement metrics (likes, retweets).
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Apply moving averages, seasonal decomposition, and
 trend detection methods. Hint: Prophet
 Outcome: Visualization of trends over time and identification of
 peak periods.
 b. Trend Analysis
 i.
 Objective: Predict future engagement metrics (likes, retweets)
 based on historical data.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Use basic time series forecasting models like ARIMA or
 exponential smoothing.
 Outcome: Predictive models that can estimate future engagement
 levels.
 c. Engagement Prediction
 i.
 Objective: Predict future engagement metrics (likes, retweets)
 based on historical data.
 ii.
 Approach: Use basic time series forecasting models like ARIMA,
 exponential smoothing.
iii.
 Outcome: Predictive models that can estimate future engagement
 levels.
 Level 2:
 a. Anomaly Detection
 i.
 Objective: Detect unusual spikes or drops in tweet activity,
 sentiment, or engagement.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Implement advanced techniques like Seasonal Hybrid
 Extreme Studentized Deviate (S-H-ESD) or deep learning models
 for anomaly detection.
 Outcome: Identification of events or actions that cause anomalies
 in the data.
 b. Causal Impact Analysis
 i.
 Objective: Assess the impact of specific events (e.g., debates,
 policy announcements) on tweet activity and sentiment.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Use models like Bayesian structural time series (BSTS)
 to quantify the effect of events.
 Outcome: Quantifiable impact analysis that can be correlated with
 key events.
 2. Natural Language Processing Tasks
 Level 1
 a. Sentiment Analysis
 i.
 Objective: Classify the sentiment of tweets (positive, negative,
 neutral) to understand public opinion on various topics like the 2020
 U.S. election, candidates, or specific issues.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Use pre-trained models like VADER, Pysentimiento for
 sentiment analysis.
 Outcome: A sentiment score that can be aggregated over time or
 by location.
 a. Hashtag Analysis
 i.
 Objective: Identify and analyze the most frequently used hashtags.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Use frequency analysis and clustering to group related
 hashtags.
 Outcome: Insights into trending topics and their geographical
 distribution.
 Level 2 (for those high achievers)
 a. Stance Detection
i.
 Objective: Identify and categorize entities such as people,
 organizations, and locations mentioned in tweets.
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Use advanced NLP libraries like SpaCy or fine-tuned
 transformers.
 Outcome: A detailed analysis of which entities are being discussed
 and how they are connected.
 b. Name Entity Recognition (NER)
 i.
 Objective: Determine the stance (supportive, opposing, neutral) of
 tweets towards specific entities (e.g., political candidates).
 ii.
 iii.
 Approach: Develop or fine-tune models specifically designed for
 stance detection.
 Outcome: Insights into public opinion polarization.
 3. Dashboard development
 Use a Data Science Visualization tool such as Streamlit or Taipy. We will select
 one to stay consistent for all students.
 a. Data Visualization
 i.
 Create interactive visualizations using libraries such as Bokeh, Seaborn
 b. User Interface Design
 i.
 Develop a user friendly UI dashboard that allows users of the tool to
 manipulate variables such as time or categories such as location,
 candidate
